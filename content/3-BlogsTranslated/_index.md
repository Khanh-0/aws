### [Dynamic Kubernetes Request Right Sizing with Kubecost](3.1-Blog1/)

This article explores how to use the **Kubecost Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) add-on** to reduce infrastructure costs and optimize Kubernetes performance. The *Container Request Right Sizing* feature evaluates how container requests are configured, identifies inefficiencies, and allows you to optimize them either manually or automatically.

We also look at how to assess right-sizing recommendations and implement updates either once or on a scheduled basis, helping an Amazon EKS environment maintain continuous optimal performance.

### [Blog 2 – Unlocking Next-Generation AI Performance with Dynamic Resource Allocation on Amazon EKS & EC2 P6e-GB200](3.2-Blog2/)

The rapid evolution of "agentic" AI and large language models (LLMs), especially inference-focused models, has created unprecedented demand for computing resources. Advanced AI models today range from hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters and require massive computational power, large memory, and high-speed interconnects to operate efficiently.

Organizations building applications for natural language processing, scientific simulation, 3D content generation, and multimodal inference need infrastructure that can scale from today’s hundred-billion-parameter models to future trillion-parameter models while maintaining performance.

### [Blog 3 – How Strangeworks Uses Amazon Braket to Explore Aircraft Loading Optimization](3.3-Blog3/)

Quantum computing promises breakthroughs for solving complex problems across industries, although its practical usefulness remains an open question. In this blog, the team from Strangeworks, an AWS partner, evaluates different implementations of the **QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)** on the aircraft loading problem posed by Airbus as part of last year’s [Quantum Mobility Challenge](https://qcc.thequantuminsider.com/).
