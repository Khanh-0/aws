During my internship at **[Company/Organization Name]** from **08/09/2025** to **09/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired in school to a real working environment.  
I participated in the **APT Magic** project, through which I improved my skills in **programming, planning, and AWS Cloud**.

Regarding work ethic, I always strived to complete assigned tasks well, follow internal rules, and actively communicate with colleagues to increase work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship journey, I provide the following self-assessment based on key criteria:
